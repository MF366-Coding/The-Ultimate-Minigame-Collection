# The Ultimate Minigame Collection
This is a console game where you can simply have fun...

### We are asking for brand new jokes for the Jokes mode! Only appropriate jokes please.

Note: you must run the main.py file - not the others!!!

# Pong Minigame
To run the Pong Minigame on Linux, you'll need the Python3.10.10 or newer and the <code>keyboard</code> module installed as <code>sudo</code>, that is <code>sudo pip install keyboard</code>.

You'll also need to run <code>sudo python3 main.py</code> instead of <code>python3 main.py</code>.
