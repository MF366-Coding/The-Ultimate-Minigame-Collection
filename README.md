# The Ultimate Minigame Collection (TUMC)
**TUMC is now including more utilities and is getting a major update that will change how you browse through the program.**

# Installation

## Linux
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MF366-Coding/The-Ultimate-Minigame-Collection.git
cd The-Ultimate-Minigame-Collection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
If you'd like to create a Virtual Environment, you can also do that.

## Windows
For Windows, there are 2 special versions in the **Releases** section:
- Portable (x64, amd64, ia64)
- Installer/Setup (x64, amd64, ia64)

Additionally, you can also do the exact same thing as you did for Linux, in case you have the following things installed:
- Python 3 (overall, it's better to use Python 3.10 or newer)
- Git
- `pip` on PATH (optional - explanation below)

If `pip` is not on the PATH, you can do:
```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Use of 'python'/'python3'
Usually, on Linux, Python is refered to as `python3` but on Windows it usually is `python`.

> ### Enjoy!
