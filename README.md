# The Ultimate Minigame Collection
This is a console game where you can simply have fun...

### We are asking for brand new jokes for the Jokes mode! Only appropriate jokes please.

### Note: you must run the main.py file - not the others!!!

# Setup
Step-by-step guide: How to install TUMC?

## Step 1: Download the *.zip file in the Releases section
On GitHub, go to Releases and download the latest zipped folder.

Extract **all** of the files to the **exact** same location.

If any file is in another location, separated from the others, the app won't run.

## Step 2: Running the app
On the folder where the files are, open the Command Prompt/Terminal.

If you are using Linux, right-click and select _Open in Terminal_ and run <code>python3 main.py</code>.

In case you're using Windows, go to the directory bar (on File Explorer) of the folder containing the files, click it and type 'cmd' and hit ENTER.
You should now be looking at the Command Prompt.
Depending on how you installed Python, the command may change.

### Installation Type 1: PATH commands
In case you installed the PATH commands for Python on Windows, run <code>python main.py</code>.

### Installation Type 2: No PATH commands
Otherwise, you might need to actually run the <code>python.exe</code> file.

## Step 3.5: Quick Important Note
Never change anything you aren't sure about in any of the files, since making one wrong change might break the app.

Please, only change things if you're experienced with Python or know what you're doing.

## Step 4: Enjoy
You can now use the app as you want.

You may also create a shortcut for it on the Desktop... whatever you'd like to do.

And thanks for using TUMC! :+1:
